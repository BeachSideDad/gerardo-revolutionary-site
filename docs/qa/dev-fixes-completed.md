- Automatic quality degradation when FPS drops below thresholds

### 3. BUNDLE OPTIMIZATION ‚úÖ
**Implementation:**
- Service Worker for asset caching (`/public/service-worker.js`)
- PWA manifest for installability (`/public/manifest.json`)
- Dynamic imports with lazy loading already in place
- Code splitting implemented via Next.js dynamic imports

## üí¨ DEVELOPER NOTES

All critical issues from the QA requirements have been addressed with emphasis on:
- Performance optimization through adaptive rendering
- Comprehensive accessibility support
- Progressive enhancement with fallbacks
- Clean code with zero suppressed errors

The site should now achieve the required 95+ Lighthouse score and maintain 60+ FPS on capable devices while gracefully degrading on lower-end hardware.
