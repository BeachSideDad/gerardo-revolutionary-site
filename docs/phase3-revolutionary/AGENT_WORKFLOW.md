# 🎭 AGENT ORCHESTRATION PLAN: Revolutionary Website Implementation

## The Challenge
Building a Lusion-level, award-worthy website requires specialized expertise across UX design, 3D development, performance optimization, and quality assurance. No single agent should handle this alone.

## 🚀 OPTIMAL AGENT WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Design & Specification (Day 1)
**Lead Agent: UX Expert (Sally)**

```bash
/BMad:agents:ux-expert
```

**Sally's Tasks:**
1. Review the REVOLUTIONARY_DESIGN_BRIEF.md
2. Use `*generate-ui-prompt` to create AI-optimized prompts for:
   - 3D Neural Universe components
   - Magnetic interaction patterns
   - Liquid transition effects
3. Use `*create-front-end-spec` to document:
   - Component hierarchy
   - Interaction flows
   - Animation specifications
   - Mobile gesture map

**Handoff:** Front-end specifications and UI prompts → Dev

---

### Phase 2: Architecture Planning (Day 1-2)
**Lead Agent: Architect (Winston)**

```bash
/BMad:agents:architect
```

**Winston's Tasks:**
1. Design Three.js/React Three Fiber architecture
2. Plan performance optimization strategy for:
   - 1000+ particles
   - Real-time shaders
   - 60 FPS target
3. Structure component system for:
   - Lazy loading 3D assets
   - Progressive enhancement
   - Fallback experiences
4. Define data flow for AI features

**Handoff:** Technical architecture → Dev

---

### Phase 3: Core Development (Days 2-5)
**Lead Agent: Developer (James)**

```bash
/BMad:agents:dev
```

**James's Tasks:**

#### Sprint 1: Neural Universe (Day 2-3)
- Implement Three.js scene with particles
- Build RPM visualizer with custom shaders
- Create scroll-driven narrative system
- Add sound engine with Howler.js

#### Sprint 2: AI Systems (Day 4)
- Build "Browse for You" conversational UI
- Implement symptom pattern visualizer
- Create dynamic page generator
- Connect to AI SDK

#### Sprint 3: Interactions (Day 5)
- Develop magnetic buttons with particle bursts
- Implement liquid page transitions
- Add 3D audience switching
- Enable mobile gestures

**Handoff:** Working implementation → QA

---

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance (Day 6)
**Lead Agent: QA (Robert)**

```bash
/BMad:agents:qa
```

**Robert's Tasks:**
1. Performance testing:
   - Verify 60 FPS across all animations
   - Check Lighthouse scores (target: 95+)
   - Test load times (<2s initial)
2. Cross-browser testing:
   - Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
   - Mobile Safari, Chrome Mobile
3. Interaction testing:
   - All particle effects trigger correctly
   - Magnetic buttons follow cursor
   - AI responses generate properly
4. Accessibility audit:
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Reduced motion support

**Handoff:** Bug reports → Dev for fixes

---

### Phase 5: Project Management (Throughout)
**Lead Agent: PM (Oliver)**

```bash
/BMad:agents:pm
```

**Oliver's Tasks:**
1. Track progress across all phases
2. Manage agent handoffs
3. Ensure timeline adherence
4. Coordinate deployment to Vercel
5. Prepare for Awwwards submission

---

## 🔄 AGENT HANDOFF PROTOCOL

### Standard Handoff Format:
```markdown
## HANDOFF: [From Agent] → [To Agent]

### Completed Work:
- [List of completed items]

### Deliverables:
- [Files created/modified]
- [Documentation produced]

### Next Steps for [To Agent]:
- [Specific tasks to execute]

### Known Issues/Considerations:
- [Any blockers or important notes]

### Success Criteria:
- [How to know the task is complete]
```

## 🎯 COORDINATION COMMANDS

### For BMad Orchestrator:

```bash
# Start the workflow
/BMad:agents:bmad-orchestrator
*workflow revolutionary-website

# Check status
*status

# Switch between agents
*agent ux-expert
*agent architect
*agent dev
*agent qa
*agent pm

# Party mode for complex discussions
*party-mode
```

## 📊 TASK DISTRIBUTION

### By Complexity & Expertise:

| Component | Primary Agent | Support Agent | Complexity |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| 3D Neural Universe | Dev | Architect | Very High |
| Custom Shaders | Dev | - | High |
| AI Browse System | Dev | UX Expert | High |
| Particle Systems | Dev | QA (performance) | Medium |
| Magnetic Buttons | Dev | UX Expert | Medium |
| Liquid Transitions | Dev | UX Expert | Medium |
| Sound Design | Dev | - | Low |
| Mobile Gestures | Dev | QA | Medium |
| Performance Optimization | Architect | QA | High |
| Visual Design Specs | UX Expert | - | Medium |
| Testing & QA | QA | - | High |

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL PATH

The following must happen in sequence:

1. **UX Expert** creates UI specifications ← BLOCKS ALL
2. **Architect** designs technical architecture ← BLOCKS DEV
3. **Dev** implements core features ← BLOCKS QA
4. **QA** tests everything ← BLOCKS DEPLOYMENT
5. **PM** coordinates deployment

---

## 💡 EFFICIENCY TIPS

### Parallel Work Opportunities:
- While Dev builds 3D scene, UX can refine interaction specs
- While Dev implements features, QA can prepare test cases
- PM tracks progress throughout, doesn't block anyone

### When to Use Party Mode:
- Initial briefing with all agents
- Complex 3D performance discussions (Architect + Dev + QA)
- Final review before deployment

### When to Switch Agents Rapidly:
- Quick questions about specific expertise
- Handoff moments
- Debugging complex issues
